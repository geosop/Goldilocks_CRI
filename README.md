# Goldilocks_CRI

Code, data, and figures for the Conscious Retroactive Intervention (CRI) Perspective manuscript and Supplementary Information (SI).

---

## Overview

This repository supports the Perspective submission:

> **"Conscious Retroactive Intervention: A Reversed-Time Framework for Predictive Cognition"**

It provides all code, synthetic data, simulations, figures, and numerical pipelines to transparently reproduce and audit the CRI framework and its supplementary analyses.

CRI (Goldilocks-CRI) proposes that neural systems can—under sharply tuned, “just-right” physiological conditions—be influenced by probabilistic information about future outcomes. This model combines predictive coding, quantum process tomography, and novel “Goldilocks” retrocausal gating, producing specific, testable signatures in behavior, EEG, and simulated neural dynamics.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic EEG Data:**  
  Generates realistic EEG with injected artifacts and spindles, for robust pipeline testing.

- **Automated Artifact Removal:**  
  Detects flat, noisy, and artifact-laden channels using peak-to-peak and variance metrics; robust even on synthetic datasets.

- **Reproducible Simulations:**  
  Full code for all simulations (decay, logistic gating, QPT) with output matching SI and manuscript figures.

- **Transparent SI Reproduction:**  
  Every table and figure in the SI can be reproduced from command line.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- MNE-Python (≥ 1.3)
- numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, pyyaml
- Picard (for ICA)
- psychopy (optional: for cue schedule)


### Quick Environment Setup (Conda recommended)

```
conda create -n goldilocks_cri python=3.9 mne numpy scipy pandas matplotlib pyyaml
conda activate goldilocks_cri
pip install picard
```
## Full Pipeline: One-Command Reproducibility

To reproduce all SI analyses and figures (using only synthetic data):

```
bash run_all.sh
```

All intermediate and final results are written to their respective output/ folders.
Figures (PDF) are generated in figures/output/.

## EEG Artifact Handling Details

- Bad channel detection is robust to both synthetic and real datasets.
- Peak-to-peak, flatness, and variance thresholds are set in default_params.yml.
- No digitization/headshape points:
  For synthetic data, interpolation sets bad channels to NaN (expected behavior).
  For real EEG with digitization, full spatial interpolation is used.
- EOG channel handling is robust to missing or NaN-valued EOG.

---

## Data and Figures

- Synthetic data (TierA, TierB) are generated to match pipeline requirements and test all artifact scenarios.
- All figures in the SI are reproducible from the generated outputs.
- Statistical analyses (permutation tests, power) are performed with published parameters.

## Known Warnings & Their Interpretation

- Interpolation failed: No digitization points found for dig_kinds=...
Expected for synthetic data. Not an error.

- interpolate_bads was called with method='nan'...
Safe for synthetic data pipelines; see script for details.

- This filename ... does not conform to MNE naming conventions
Outputs cab be renamed to e.g., _raw.fif or _eeg.fif for full BIDS/MNE compatibility.

- UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout
Figure aesthetics only; no impact on results.

## Using with Real EEG Data

To apply the artifact pipeline to real EEG, place the .fif data in the appropriate input directory, ensure digitization/headshape points are present, and update default_params.yml for the channel naming and thresholds. See comments in preprocessing/artifact_pipeline.py.
